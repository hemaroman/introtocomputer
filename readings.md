What is queue in java?
Queue in Java is a linear ordered data structure that follows FIFO (First In, First Out) ordering of elements. This means that the element inserted first in the queue will be the first element to be removed. In Java, the queue is implemented as an interface that inherits the Collection interface.
What is stacked in java?
A stack is a linear data structure. It provides a container to store data items which can be accessed from one side of the container only. Here the element that is inserted at last is deleted first. This is called the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It means that we can only access the latest entered elements.
What is linked list in java?
Linked List is a part of the Collection framework present in java.util package. This class is an implementation of the Linked List data structure which is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node. 
Due to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over the arrays. It also has a few disadvantages like the nodes cannot be accessed directly instead we need to start from the head and follow through the link to reach a node we wish to access.
What is tree in java? 
•	A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or entities known as nodes that are linked together to represent or simulate hierarchy.
•	A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.
•	In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. In the above tree structure, the node contains the name of the employee, so the type of data would be a string.
•	Each node contains some data and the link or reference of other nodes that can be called children.
What is exception handling in java?
The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained. In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime.
Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.


There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. An error is considered as the unchecked exception. However, according to Oracle, there are three types of exceptions namely:

•	Checked Exception
•	Unchecked Exception
•	Error
•
