#1.	What are transistors?

A Transistor is an Electric device that regulates the flow of Electric Current and Voltage or is defined as a semiconductor device that’s fundamentally built with three terminals for amplifying or switching electronic signals and electrical power purposes. 
That has many functions, such as switching, amplifying, detecting, signal modulation, and more.  In almost all modern electronics, Transistors are the most important active components.
Commonly classified into Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT), and Field Effect Transistors (FET), these devices allow for the existence of radios, computers, calculators, etc. that you use today.
Parts of transistor  
•	Base: The base is used to activate the Transistor.
•	Collector: The Transistor's positive lead is known as the collector.
•	Emitter: The Transistor's emitter is the negative lead.

#2.	 Moore's law?

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. 
Moore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, thus functioning to some extent as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Advancements in digital electronics, such as the reduction in quality-adjusted microprocessor prices, the increase in memory capacity (RAM and flash), the improvement of sensors, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras, are strongly linked to Moore's law. These ongoing changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth.
#3.	Lambda calculus?
Lambda calculus (λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. 
It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine.  It was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics. 
Until the 1960s when its relation to programming languages was clarified, the lambda calculus was only a formalism. Thanks to Richard Montague and other linguists' applications in the semantics of natural language, the lambda calculus has begun to enjoy a respectable place in both linguistics and computer science. 

#4.	How computers work? 

A computer is a programmable electronic device capable of processing information. Composed of hardware and software, computers operate on two levels: they receive data through an input route, either live or through a digital storage unit, and send out an output.
How Does a Computer Work?
A computer processes the input to produce the desired output, but how does a machine outperform the human brain?
Conventional computers don't try to mimic the human brain. Instead, they run commands sequentially, with data constantly moving from input and memory to the device's processor. Neuromorphic computers, on the other hand, process data at the same time, making them faster, energy-efficient, and closer to the structure of the human brain.
Overall, a computer works in four steps:
•	Input: Input is the data before processing. It comes from the mouse, keyboard, microphone, and other external sensors.
•	Storage: The storage is how the computer retains input data. The hard drive is used for long-term and mass data storage while the data set for immediate processing is stored temporarily in the Random-Access Memory (RAM).

•	Processing: Processing is where input gets transformed into output. The computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU) is its brain. It's responsible for executing instructions and performing mathematical operations on the input data.
•	Output: Output is the final result of data processing. It can be anything from images, video, or audio content, even the words you type using a keyboard. You can also receive the output through a printer or a projector instead of directly through your device.
